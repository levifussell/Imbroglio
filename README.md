# Imbroglio
an ASCII game made during my console-game obsessive years. Creates a randomly generated maze that the user must navigate and uses mouse-to-console interaction.

Because this game is outdated, it's original compiler was VS11 in win32 C++. The game will not compile now unless updated and it is free for anyone to do so. Or you can just download the .exe file and enjoy!
